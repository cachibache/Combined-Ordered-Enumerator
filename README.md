Combined-Ordered-Enumerator in Ruby 1.9
===========================

Combined Ordered Enumerator exercise and tests.

This is an exercise using lazy evaluation of finite and infinite enumerators in Ruby 1.9, 
and therefore without the benefits introduced in Ruby 2.0 for these purposes.

My work is shown on lines 24 - 62.  Everything else was provided as shown.
